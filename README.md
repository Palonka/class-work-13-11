Note. Ensure to follow good programming habits (such as object naming / versioning at appropriate stages) while creating the application

Stage 1. Create a C# Windows Form App based on the provided sketch

Stage 2. Assign relevant variables to store the "result" variables and the date

Stage 3. Create a button to calculate the results using if statements and assign to the appropriate variables

Stage 4. Set the if statements as a method that is triggered when any objects values change

Stage 5. Modify the method to use a more appropriate control statement

Stage 6. Hide the "results" as part of your created method

Stage 7. Add a button that returns the current date and gives the user the option to change it (a messagebox may be an option here...)

Stage 8. When the user opts to continue show the "results" and save them (along with the date)

Stage 9. Add a timer which closes the application after the results have been appended to the results file and 10 seconds have elapsed

Stage 10. Create a new application that returns, in an appropriate format, the results from the results file
How could the application be improved?
